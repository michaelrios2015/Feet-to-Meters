This is the assignment the project was created for 

COSC 501(AIT 500)      Project 3  Due: Oct 22, 2013 
 
 
Write a C++ program that reads in a length in feet and inches and outputs the equivalent length in meters and centimeters.  
 
Use at least three functions: (1) One function for input with two variable parameters (2) One value-returning function for calculation that has two parameters (feet and inches) that return the length in meters and centimeters (one value) (3) One function for output.  
 
 
Include a loop that lets the user repeat this computation for new  input values until the user says he or she wants to end the program.  
 
 
Hints:  
-0.3048 meters in a foot
